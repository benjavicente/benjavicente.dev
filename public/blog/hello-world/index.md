## Hi!

I had created a lot of personal blogs, but nothing really stuck.
Making past personal websites and blogs where really an excuse to learn new technologies.
I can't say that I didn't do the same this time, but this result seems to be more promising.

This attempt of a blog is build with NextJS, MDXRemote, TailwindCSS, and Shikiji.
I was between NextJS and Astro, but Astro don't embracing JS is a deal breaker.
Thanks to JS (via React SSC), posts can show interactiva components and generate an image for social media.

```js
<Confetti />
```

```js eval
<Confetti />
```

For inspiration, I checked out [Dan Abramov's blog](https://overreacted.io/).
Initially I didn't know how that blog was made, and mainly followed the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) approach that Dan shows in his webpages.
When I started programming this blog, I found on GitHub Issues, Dan's solutions of problems that I had. This landed me to his blog [source code](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io), where most of the code of this blog is based on.

## What now?

Since now I started exploring in more detail how JS Frameworks work, I will try to write some thoughts and explanations about them.
It's not intended as a reference, since I don't hace the experience to back it up, but might be a good place to learn something, and a time capsule to show how my progresion in this JS framework madness.
