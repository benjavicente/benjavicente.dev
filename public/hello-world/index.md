## Hi!

I had created multiple repos for a blog, but nothing stuck.
Making past personal websites and blogs where an excuse to learn new technologies.
I can't say that I didn't do the same this time.

This blog is build with NextJS, MDXRemote (by Hashicorp), TailwindCSS, and Shikiji (via rehype-pretty-code).
I was between NextJS and Astro, but Astro don't embracing JS is a deal breaker.

For inspiration, I checked out [Dan Abramov's blog](https://overreacted.io/).
Initially I didn't know how that blog was made, and mainly followed the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) approach that Dan shows in his webpages.
When I started programming this blog, I found on GitHub Issues, Dan's solutions of problems that I had. This landed me to his blog source code, where most of the code of this blog is based on.

```js eval
<Counter/>
```

## What now?

Since now I started exploring in more detail how JS Frameworks work, I will try to write some thoughts and explanations about them.
It's not intended as a reference, since I don't hace the experience to back it up, but might be a good place to learn something, and a time capsule to show how my progresion in this JS framework madness.
